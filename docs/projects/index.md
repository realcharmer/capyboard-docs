# Projects

Welcome to the Projects section. Here, you can find examples of how to use Capyboard and all its modules. The projects are split into groups for each available module and are ordered by difficulty. Start at the top and continue downward as you become comfortable with solving the tasks and ideally all of their [challenges](#challenges).

!!! warning

    Before you start, make sure you have read the [installation instructions](../getting-started/installation.md) and set up your development environment. Additionally, download the [starter template](../getting-started/project-template.md) to save yourself a lot of manual work.

## Examples

Most of the projects include a simple working example to help you get started. However, you should try solving the task yourself first.

## Challenges

Many projects also include challenges, offering interesting extensions of the base project. Try solving all of them. You can find the challenges in a collapsible block, like so:
