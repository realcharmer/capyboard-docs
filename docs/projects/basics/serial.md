# Serial

A serial connection allows you to communicate with your device. Capyboard has a USB-C connector with a fully functional serial interface.

Connect your Capyboard to a computer, download the [starter template](../../getting-started/project-template.md), build it, flash the firmware, and watch the serial output for messages. You should see a simple "Hello!" message over and over.

```
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
Hello!
```
