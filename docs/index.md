# Capyboard

Welcome to the Capyboard documentation.

This is a documentation written for the [Capyboard devkit](https://github.com/realcharmer/capyboard) as a part of my master's thesis. Capyboard is a development board based on ESP32 and created specifically as an educational tool for gymnasiums and secondary schools. It can, however, be used in a wide range of real-world applications, just like any other ESP32 development kit.

Capyboard and all its assets are fully open-source, including the board and module schematics.
