# Installation

Capyboard is completely agnostic in terms of operating systems, as long as your system supports building firmware for ESP32, which covers most widely-used operating systems.

It can be used in many ways, just like any other development kit, for example with Arduino IDE. This documentation assumes using [PlatformIO][1]. If you wish to follow this documentation and examples, you have to have a working instance of PlatformIO installed. Please follow the official PlatformIO installation guide. You can either choose to use the simple [Platformio Core (CLI)][2] or the fully featured [PlatformIO IDE][3] based on Visual Studio Code.

Again, this guide and examples is written around using PlatformIO Core, which allows you to use your favorite editor.

You can continue by preparing a [basic project template](project-template.md).
